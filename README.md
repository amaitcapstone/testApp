# Creating your repository
In order to deploy your app, you need to have your project in a git repository. If you have not yet created one, go to the root of your ionic app and create one. Also add all current files and make your first commit:
> git init

> git add .

> git commit -am 'Initial commit.'

# Pull other default files in github
> git remote add origin [github url here]

> git pull origin master

> git push -u origin master
